# Feedback Loop Form

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Sprint_

This App is a mock version of the feedback us students at Prime take after class every day. It's for users (or students) to leave feedback on how well they are doing on both a mental health level, as well as in terms of the content being taught. There are 4 pages of forms- feeling, support, understanding, and an optional page to leave a comment.  

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A browser of choice. 

## Installation

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Fill out the forms with the answer you see fit. 
2. Once you fill everything out, you will be brought to a review page. If you would like to submit your feedback with the current values, click submit. 
3. View your submission on the final page. If you would like to leave more feedback, leave the button by the same name.
